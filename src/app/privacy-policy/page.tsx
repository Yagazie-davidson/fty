        neutral platform and we don&apos;t arbitrate disputes, however in case
        if someone writes a review that the store does not consider to be true,

        reviewer or post a public response in order to clear up any
        misunderstandings. If the store believes that any particular user&apos;s
        review violates any of the Frootifys&apos; policies, the store may write
        to us at hello@frootify.tech and bring such violation to our attention.
        Frootify may remove the review in its sole discretion if the review is
        in violation of the Terms, or content guidelines and policies or
        otherwise harmful to the Services IX. Content guidelines and privacy
